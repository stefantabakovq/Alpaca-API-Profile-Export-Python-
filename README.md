# Alpaca API Profile Export Python
An open-source Python (3.12 tested but supported by 3.14 and up.) aplication for acquiring all the data that the Alpaca Statement API v2 allows. 
Allows for both paper and live account export via Api. Alpaca suggests API as the official and, currently, only way to export. 
There is no way to export via UI - so API and this easy program is the easiest and best way to get official data from Alpaca! 

# Export and configuration
Either fill in config.json with API keys, secret and mode (paper or live) OR 
run and enter in the keys and instructions in the terminal (if config.json does now contain necessary information)

A Data/............... folder will be made and filled in with Positions, Orders, Statement, Transactions, Account Summary and much more.
